    id: arrowdestinations
    answer: >-
      You have available 8 directions for each panorama in your tour.\n These directions are in degrees, each arrow represent a direction.  Directions are represented in : 0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315 degrees in total sum 360Â°. You can choose any you like.  At the right side of each arrow, you have a list of alls the panoramas available in your tour. You just need to select the panorama that you want to load when the user click on that arrow. Automatically the preview is updated and you can click on the arrows to test them. (Be be careful if the option "navigation mode" is set to "only List", you won't be able to see the arrow in your map)  Important: Do not forget add arrows to go back to the previous panorama, or your visitor will be stuck.  This Navigation mode is know like "Arrows" remember that you also have the "List" mode. But you can not have both in the same time.  Each panorama will be loaded in the same point of view (position) that was saved. So if you want that a panorama will be loaded in one particular direction of your image, you should go to that panorama, go to the edit and drag the panorama pointing out where you want and save it.

  - title: What is "Preload all panoramas" ?
    id: whatispreloadpanos
    answer: >-
      If you turn on this option, all panoramas(only uploaded) will be preloaded when the tour start. This can improve the loading of panoramas meanwhile the user is navigating. But be careful, do not do this if you know that your users are using mobile network because you will spend of their mobile data. It can be useful for small tours, maybe 1-5 panormas. But is not recommended for bigger tour, Only use this option if you know that your users are using WIFI.  In average a unique panorama will load 1mb of images, you can use this information to know the size of your tour.
  - title: How to use POV Editor ?
    id: usepoveditor
    answer: >- 
      By default, all panoramas in your tour are loaded in the same direction of the previous panorama visited. With the POV editor you can change the "point of view" (POV) for all the panoramas inside a tour. In this way, you can define the direction where a panorama should be pointed when is loaded for first time only, subsequent visits to the same panorama will not take effect. See the following video for an explanation.  Video in English and EspaÃ±ol.
  - title: What is "Select panoramas to show name after Drag" option ?
    id: selectpanoramasoption
    answer: >-
      During the process of dragging the scene the name of the current panorama loaded will appear. You can choose in which panoramas you would like show the name.
  - title: What is "Compass orientation help" option ?
    id: compassoroption
    answer: >-
      On big tours, users can easily lose orientation of where they are. In these cases, you can add a compass to help them to know where is the north. In order to use this option, you must open the compass editor and set where is the north in each uploaded panorama.  If you set the north in all panoramas, we can build a mini map with all routes that users need to walk through inside your tours. This minimap is auto generated and sometimes can not be correct due to the big possibilities of routes. In this cases, you can hide the minimap, setting the option "Show minimap of routes" to false.  Note: minimap only works with navigation mode : arrows and hotspots. Map of routes only work with tours with one single floor plan . What I mean is : If you have stairs or elevators won't work because we can not represent those items in a 2D map. If this if your case please consider the creation of an independent tour for each floor plan
  - title: How use the list mode in you tours ?
    id: listmode
    answer: >-
      Mode list is an alternative to the arrow destination mode. You visitor will see a list instead of the classic arrows.  Depending of the number of panoramas added in your tour, you will see the same number of items on the list.
      By default all items will have the same that the corresponding panorama. But you can change it, if you want. With the input at the bottom of each item list you can customize the name.  Also you can set a image presentation for the list that will appear at the top of the list.  This Navigation mode is know like "list" remember that you also have the "arrow" mode. But you can not have both in the same time.  (Be be careful if the option "navigation mode" is set to "only List", you won't be able to see the arrow in your map)  Each panorama will be loaded in the same point of view (position) that was saved. So if you want that a panorama will be loaded in one particular direction of your image, you should go to that panorama, go to the edit and drag the panorama pointing out where you want and save it.

This is the best option to use.  youtube videos: Panoramas will have a mini video, this is a little annoying but if you do not mind you can use it.  Each individual panorama can has a background sound and every time a panorama is loaded, the sound will be downloaded and play it. This mean that if you add lots of sounds your users will be downloading all these files and the tour could be slow. Be careful with this.  If a tour and panorama ave a background in the same time. The tour sound will be played.
